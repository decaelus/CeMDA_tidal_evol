\section{How to introduce references in text}
The determination of the age of the family has been the concern of some authors who studied stable chaos (Firstauthor 1979, Author and Coauthor 1999, Another 2009).
Herein, we use the formulations given by Onemore (1979). That formulation 
was developed to study it specifically ´ by Secondmore (1989, 1993).
