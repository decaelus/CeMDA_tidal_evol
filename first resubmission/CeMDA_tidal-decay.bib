    abstract = {{THE} recent {discovery<SUP}>{1</SUP}> and {confirmation<SUP}>{2</SUP}> of a
possible planetary companion orbiting the solar-type star 51 Pegasi
represent a breakthrough in the search for extrasolar planetary systems.
Analysis of systematic variations in the velocity of the star indicate
that the mass of the companion is approximately that of Jupiter, and
that it is travelling in a nearly circular orbit at a distance from the
star of 0.05 {AU} (about seven stellar radii). Here we show that, if the
companion is indeed a gas-giant planet, it is extremely unlikely to have
formed at its present location. We suggest instead that the planet
probably formed by gradual accretion of solids and capture of gas at a
much larger distance from the star (\~{}5 {AU}), and that it subsequently
migrated inwards through interactions with the remnants of the
circumstellar disk. The planet's migration may have stopped in its
present orbit as a result of tidal interactions with the star, or
through truncation of the inner circumstellar disk by the stellar
magnetosphere.},

@article{Fortney2007Planetary,
    abstract = {To aid in the physical interpretation of planetary radii constrained
through observations of transiting planets, or eventually direct
detections, we compute model radii of pure hydrogen-helium, water, rock,
and iron planets, along with various mixtures. Masses ranging from 0.01
Earth masses to 10 Jupiter masses at orbital distances of 0.02-10 {AU} are
considered. For hydrogen-helium rich planets, our models are the first
to couple planetary evolution to stellar irradiation over a wide range
of orbital separations (0.02-10 {AU}) through a nongray
radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model. Stellar irradiation
retards the contraction of giant planets, but its effect is not a simple
function of the irradiation level: a planet at 1 {AU} contracts as slowly
as a planet at 0.1 {AU}. We confirm the assertion of Guillot that very old
giant planets under modest stellar irradiation (like that received by
Jupiter and Saturn) develop isothermal atmospheric radiative zones once
the planet's intrinsic flux drops to a small fraction of the incident
flux. For hydrogen-helium planets, we consider cores up to 90\% of the
total planet mass, comparable to those of Uranus and Neptune. If ``hot
Neptunes'' have maintained their original masses and are not remnants of
more massive planets, radii of \~{}0.30-0.45 {R<SUB}>{J</SUB}> are expected.
Water planets are \~{}40\%-50\% larger than rocky planets, independent of
mass. Finally, we provide tables of planetary radii at various ages and
compositions, and for ice-rock-iron planets we fit our results to
analytic functions, which will allow for quick composition estimates,
given masses and radii, or mass estimates, given only planetary radii.
These results will assist in the interpretation of observations for both
the current transiting planet surveys as well as upcoming space
missions, including {COROT} and Kepler.},

giant planets over a range in mass and irradiating flux. The cooling
rate of the planet is sensitive to the surface boundary condition, which
depends on the detailed manner in which starlight is absorbed and energy
redistributed by fluid motion. We parameterize these effects by imposing
an isothermal boundary condition {T\&equiv;T}<{SUB}>{deep</SUB}> below the
photosphere and then constrain {T<SUB}>{deep</SUB}> from the observed masses
and radii. We compute the dependence of luminosity and core temperature
on mass, {T<SUB}>{deep</SUB}>, and core entropy, finding that simple
scalings apply over most of the relevant parameter space. These scalings
yield analytic cooling models that exhibit power-law behavior in the
observable age range 0.1-10 Gyr and are confirmed by time-dependent
cooling calculations. We compare our model to the radii of observed
transiting planets and derive constraints on {T<SUB}>{deep</SUB}>. Only {HD}
209458 has a sufficiently accurate radius measurement that
{T<SUB}>{deep</SUB}> is tightly constrained; the lower error bar on the
radii for other planets is consistent with no irradiation. More accurate
radius and age measurements will allow for a determination of the

presented in order to establish the energy-limited flux of escaping
particles. The model assumes that the atmosphere is tightly bound by

heating is solar {EUV}. The flux is limited by the amount of {EUV} energy
absorbed, which is in turn controlled by the radial extent of the
thermosphere. It is found that, regardless of the amount of hydrogen in
the thermosphere, the low temperatures which accompany rapid escape
limit its extent and thus constrain the flux. The results are applied to
the earth and Venus, showing that the escape of hydrogen from these
planets would have been energy-limiting if their primordial atmospheres

(X-rays to {UV}) of solar analogs with ages covering \~{}0.1-7 Gyr. The chief
science goals are to study the solar magnetic dynamo and to determine
the radiative and magnetic properties of the Sun during its evolution
across the main sequence. The present paper focuses on the latter goal,
which has the ultimate purpose of providing the spectral irradiance
evolution of solar-type stars to be used in the study and modeling of
planetary atmospheres. The results from the Sun in Time program suggest
that the coronal {X-ray-EUV} emissions of the young main-sequence Sun were
\~{}100-1000 times stronger than those of the present Sun. Similarly, the
transition region and chromospheric {FUV}-{UV} emissions of the young Sun
are expected to be 20-60 and 10-20 times stronger, respectively, than at
present. When we consider the integrated high-energy emission from 1 to
1200 \&\#197;, the resulting relationship indicates that about 2.5 Gyr
ago the solar high-energy flux was about 2.5 times the present value and
about 3.5 Gyr ago was about 6 times the present value (when life
supposedly arose on Earth). The strong radiation emissions inferred
should have had major influences on the thermal structure,
photochemistry, and photoionization of planetary atmospheres and have
played an important role in the development of primitive life in the
solar system. Some examples of the application of the Sun in Time

@article{Owen2012Planetary,
    abstract = {We consider the evaporation of close-in planets by the star's intrinsic
extreme-ultraviolet ({EUV}) and X-ray radiation. We calculate evaporation
rates by solving the hydrodynamical problem for planetary evaporation
including heating from both X-ray and {EUV} radiation. We show that most
close-in planets (a < 0.1 au) are evaporating hydrodynamically, with
the evaporation occurring in two distinct regimes: X-ray driven, in
which the X-ray heated flow contains a sonic point, and {EUV} driven, in
which the X-ray region is entirely sub-sonic. The mass-loss rates scale
as {L<SUB}>{X</SUB}>/{a<SUP}>{2</SUP}> for X-ray driven evaporation, and as
Phi*1/2/a for {EUV} driven evaporation at early times, with mass-loss
rates of the order of {10<SUP}>{10</SUP}>-{10<SUP}>{14</SUP}> g {s<SUP}>-{1</SUP}>.
No exact scaling exists for the mass-loss rate with planet mass and
planet radius; however, in general evaporation proceeds more rapidly for
planets with lower densities and higher masses. Furthermore, we find
that in general the transition from X-ray driven to {EUV} driven
evaporation occurs at lower X-ray luminosities for planets closer to
their parent stars and for planets with lower densities.<p/>

Coupling our evaporation models to the evolution of the high-energy
radiation - which falls with time - we are able to follow the evolution
of evaporating planets. We find that most planets start off evaporating
in the X-ray driven regime, but switch to {EUV} driven once the X-ray
luminosity falls below a critical value. The evolution models suggest
that while 'hot Jupiters' are evaporating, they are not evaporating at a
rate sufficient to remove the entire gaseous envelope on Gyr
time-scales. However, we do find that close in Neptune mass planets are
more susceptible to complete evaporation of their envelopes. Thus we
conclude that planetary evaporation is more important for lower mass
planets, particularly those in the 'hot Neptune'/'super Earth' regime.},

Jupiters'' due to the gravitational field of the host star is
presented.  <{BR} />Aims: The influence of the proximity to a planet of
the Roche lobe boundary on the critical temperature for blow-off
conditions for estimating the increase of the mass loss rate through
hydrodynamic blow-off for close-in exoplanets is investigated.  <{BR}
/>Methods: We consider the gravitational potential for a star and a
planet along the line that joins their mass centers and the energy
balance equation for an evaporating planetary atmosphere including the
effect of the stellar tidal force on atmospheric escape.  <{BR} />Results:
By studying the effect of the Roche lobe on the atmospheric loss from
short-periodic gas giants we derived reasonably accurate approximate
formulas to estimate atmospheric loss enhancement due to the action of
tidal forces on a ``Hot Jupiter'' and to calculate the
critical temperature for the onset of ``geometrical
blow-off'', which are valid for any physical values of the Roche
lobe radial distance. Using these formulas, we found that the stellar
tidal forces can enhance the hydrodynamic evaporation rate from {TreS}-1
and {OGLE}-{TR}-56b by about 2 fold, while for {HD} 209458b we found an
enhancement of about 50\%. For similar exoplanets which are closer to
their host star than {OGLE}-{TR}-56b, the mass loss enhancement can be even
larger. Moreover, we showed that the effect of the Roche lobe allows
``Hot Jupiters'' to reach blow-off conditions at temperatures
which are less than expected due to the stellar X-ray and {EUV} heating.},

loss to understand the formation and evolution of the Kepler-36 system.
We show that the large contrast in mean planetary density observed by
Carter et al. can be explained as a natural consequence of
photo-evaporation from planets that formed with similar initial
compositions. However, rather than being due to differences in {XUV}
irradiation between the planets, we find that this contrast is due to
the difference in the masses of the planets' rock/iron cores and the
impact that this has on mass-loss evolution. We explore in detail how
our coupled models depend on irradiation, mass, age, composition, and
the efficiency of mass loss. Based on fits to large numbers of coupled
evolution and mass-loss runs, we provide analytic fits to understand
threshold {XUV} fluxes for significant atmospheric loss, as a function of
core mass and mass-loss efficiency. Finally we discuss these results in
the context of recent studies of the radius distribution of Kepler
candidates. Using our parameter study, we make testable predictions for
the frequency of {sub-Neptune}-sized planets. We show that 1.8-4.0 R

detail and provide estimates of both the current and past planetary
compositions. We find that an {H/He} envelope on Kepler-11b is highly
vulnerable to mass loss. By comparing to formation models, we show that
in situ formation of the system is extremely difficult. Instead we
propose that it is a water-rich system of {sub-Neptunes} that migrated
from beyond the snow line. For the broader population of observed
planets, we show that there is a threshold in bulk planet density and
incident flux above which no low-mass transiting planets have been

{H/He} envelopes to {XUV}-driven mass loss. Importantly, we find that this
mass-loss threshold is well reproduced by our thermal
evolution/contraction models that incorporate a standard mass-loss
prescription. Treating the planets' contraction history is essential
because the planets have significantly larger radii during the early era
of high {XUV} fluxes. Over time low-mass planets with {H/He} envelopes can
be transformed into water-dominated worlds with steam envelopes or rocky

@article{Essick2015Orbital,
    abstract = {We study the orbital evolution of hot Jupiters due to the excitation and
damping of tidally driven \$g\$-modes within solar-type host stars.
Linearly resonant \$g\$-modes (the dynamical tide) are driven to such
large amplitudes in the stellar core that they excite a sea of other
\$g\$-modes through weakly nonlinear interactions. By solving the dynamics
of large networks of nonlinearly coupled modes, we show that the
nonlinear dissipation rate of the dynamical tide is several orders of
magnitude larger than the linear dissipation rate. As a result, we find
that the orbits of planets with mass \$M\_p \&gt; 0.5M\_J\$ and period \$P
\&lt; 2\textrm{ days}\$ decay on timescales that are small compared to the
main-sequence lifetime of their solar-type hosts. This corresponds to
stellar tidal quality factors \$Q\_\ast^\prime \simeq 10^5-10^6\$ for this
range of \$M\_p\$ and \$P\$. Our results imply that there are \$\simeq10\$
currently known exoplanetary systems, including WASP-19b and HAT-P-36-b,
with orbital decay timescales shorter than a Gyr. Rapid, tide induced
orbital decay may explain the observed paucity of planets with \$M\_p \&gt;
M\_J\$ and \$P\&lt; 2\textrm{ days}\$ around solar-type hosts and could
generate detectable transit-timing variations in the near future.},

@article{Jackson2008Tidal,
    abstract = {The distribution of eccentricities e of extrasolar planets with
semimajor axes a\&gt;0.2 {AU} is very uniform, and values for e are
relatively large, averaging 0.3 and broadly distributed up to near 1.
For a\&lt;0.2 {AU}, eccentricities are much smaller (most e\&lt;0.2), a
characteristic widely attributed to damping by tides after the planets
formed and the protoplanetary gas disk dissipated. Most previous
estimates of the tidal damping considered the tides raised on the
planets, but ignored the tides raised on the stars. Most also assumed
specific values for the planets' poorly constrained tidal dissipation
parameter {Q<SUB}>{p</SUB}>. Perhaps most important, in many studies the
strongly coupled evolution between e and a was ignored. We have now
integrated the coupled tidal evolution equations for e and a over the
estimated age of each planet, and confirmed that the distribution of
initial e values of close-in planets matches that of the general
population for reasonable Q values, with the best fits for stellar and
planetary Q being \~{}{10<SUP}>{5.5</SUP}> and \~{}{10<SUP}>{6.5</SUP}>, respectively.
The accompanying evolution of a values shows most close-in planets had
significantly larger a at the start of tidal migration. The earlier gas
disk migration did not bring all planets to their current orbits. The
current small values of a were only reached gradually due to tides over
the lifetimes of the planets. These results may have important
implications for planet formation models, atmospheric models of ``hot
Jupiters,'' and the success of transit surveys.},

@article{Li2010WASP12b,
    abstract = {The class of exotic Jupiter-mass planets that orbit very close to their parent stars were not explicitly expected before their discovery1. The recently discovered2 transiting planet {WASP}-12b has a mass M = 1.4 ± 0.1 Jupiter masses (M J), a mean orbital distance of only 3.1 stellar radii (meaning it is subject to intense tidal forces), and a period of 1.1 days. Its radius 1.79 ± {0.09R} J is unexpectedly large and its orbital eccentricity 0.049 ± 0.015 is even more surprising because such close orbits are usually quickly circularized. Here we report an analysis of its properties, which reveals that the planet is losing mass to its host star at a rate of about 10-7 M J per year. The planet's surface is distorted by the star's gravity and the light curve produced by its prolate shape will differ by about ten per cent from that of a spherical planet. We conclude that dissipation of the star's tidal perturbation in the planet's convective envelope provides the energy source for its large volume. We predict up to 10 {mJy} {CO} band-head (2.292 μm) emission from a tenuous disk around the host star, made up of tidally stripped planetary gas. It may also contain a detectable resonant {super-Earth}, as a hypothetical perturber that continually stirs up {WASP}-12b's eccentricity.},

@article{Howard2012Planet,
    abstract = {We report the distribution of planets as a function of planet radius,
orbital period, and stellar effective temperature for orbital periods
less than 50 days around solar-type ({GK}) stars. These results are based
on the 1235 planets (formally "planet candidates") from the Kepler
mission that include a nearly complete set of detected planets as small
as 2 R <{SUB}>\&{oplus;</SUB}>. For each of the 156,000 target stars, we
assess the detectability of planets as a function of planet radius, R
<{SUB}>{p</SUB}>, and orbital period, P, using a measure of the detection
efficiency for each star. We also correct for the geometric probability
of transit, R <{SUB}>{sstarf</SUB}>/a. We consider first Kepler target stars
within the "solar subset" having T <{SUB}>{eff</SUB}> = 4100-6100 K, log g =
4.0-4.9, and Kepler magnitude Kp \&lt; 15 mag, i.e., bright,
main-sequence {GK} stars. We include only those stars having photometric
noise low enough to permit detection of planets down to 2 R
<{SUB}>\&{oplus;</SUB}>. We count planets in small domains of R <{SUB}>{p</SUB}>
and P and divide by the included target stars to calculate planet
occurrence in each domain. The resulting occurrence of planets varies by
more than three orders of magnitude in the radius-orbital period plane
and increases substantially down to the smallest radius (2 R
<{SUB}>\&{oplus;</SUB}>) and out to the longest orbital period (50 days,
\~{}0.25 {AU}) in our study. For P \&lt; 50 days, the distribution of planet
radii is given by a power law, df/dlog R = {k<SUB}>{R</SUB}>R
<{SUP}>{alpha</SUP}> with {k<SUB}>{R</SUB}> = {2.9<SUP}>+{0.5</SUP}> <{SUB}>-
{0.4</SUB}>, alpha = -1.92 \&\#177; 0.11, and R \&equiv; R <{SUB}>{p</SUB}>/R
<{SUB}>\&{oplus;</SUB}>. This rapid increase in planet occurrence with
decreasing planet size agrees with the prediction of core-accretion
formation but disagrees with population synthesis models that predict a
desert at {super-Earth} and Neptune sizes for close-in orbits. Planets
with orbital periods shorter than 2 days are extremely rare; for R
<{SUB}>{p</SUB}> \&gt; 2 R <{SUB}>\&{oplus;</SUB}> we measure an occurrence of
less than 0.001 planets per star. For all planets with orbital periods
less than 50 days, we measure occurrence of 0.130 \&\#177; 0.008, 0.023
\&\#177; 0.003, and 0.013 \&\#177; 0.002 planets per star for planets
with radii 2-4, 4-8, and 8-32 R <{SUB}>\&{oplus;</SUB}>, in agreement with
Doppler surveys. We fit occurrence as a function of P to a power-law
model with an exponential cutoff below a critical period P <{SUB}>{0</SUB}>.
For smaller planets, P <{SUB}>{0</SUB}> has larger values, suggesting that
the "parking distance" for migrating planets moves outward with
decreasing planet size. We also measured planet occurrence over a
broader stellar T <{SUB}>{eff</SUB}> range of 3600-7100 K, spanning M0 to F2
dwarfs. Over this range, the occurrence of 2-4 R <{SUB}>\&{oplus;</SUB}>
planets in the Kepler field increases with decreasing T <{SUB}>{eff</SUB}>,
with these small planets being seven times more abundant around cool
stars (3600-4100 K) than the hottest stars in our sample (6600-7100 K).<p/>

@article{Queloz2009CoRoT7,
    abstract = {We report on an intensive observational campaign carried out with {HARPS}
at the 3.6 m telescope at La Silla on the star {CoRoT}-7. Additional
simultaneous photometric measurements carried out with the Euler Swiss
telescope have demonstrated that the observed radial velocity variations
are dominated by rotational modulation from cool spots on the stellar
surface. Several approaches were used to extract the radial velocity
signal of the planet(s) from the stellar activity signal. First, a
simple pre-whitening procedure was employed to find and subsequently
remove periodic signals from the complex frequency structure of the
radial velocity data. The dominant frequency in the power spectrum was
found at 23 days, which corresponds to the rotation period of {CoRoT}-7.
The 0.8535 day period of {CoRoT}-7b planetary candidate was detected with
an amplitude of 3.3 m {s<SUP}>-{1</SUP}>. Most other frequencies, some with
amplitudes larger than the {CoRoT}-7b signal, are most likely associated
with activity. A second approach used harmonic decomposition of the
rotational period and up to the first three harmonics to filter out the
activity signal from radial velocity variations caused by orbiting
planets. After correcting the radial velocity data for activity, two
periodic signals are detected: the {CoRoT}-7b transit period and a second
one with a period of 3.69 days and an amplitude of 4 m {s<SUP}>-{1</SUP}>.
This second signal was also found in the pre-whitening analysis. We
attribute the second signal to a second, more remote planet {CoRoT}-7c .
The orbital solution of both planets is compatible with circular orbits.
The mass of {CoRoT}-7b is 4.8\&\#177;0.8 ({M<SUB}>\&{oplus;</SUB}>) and that of
{CoRoT}-7c is 8.4\&\#177; 0.9 ({M<SUB}>\&{oplus;</SUB}>), assuming both planets
are on coplanar orbits. We also investigated the false positive scenario
of a blend by a faint stellar binary, and this may be rejected by the
stability of the bisector on a nightly scale. According to their masses
both planets belong to the {super-Earth} planet category. The average
density of {CoRoT}-7b is rho=5.6\&\#177; 1.3 g {cm<SUP}>-{3</SUP}>, similar
to the Earth. The {CoRoT}-7 planetary system provides us with the first
insight into the physical nature of short period {super-Earth} planets
recently detected by radial velocity surveys. These planets may be
denser than Neptune and therefore likely made of rocks like the Earth,
or a mix of water ice and rocks.<p/>

information on the distribution of planetary radii, particularly for the
new populations of {super-Earth}- and {sub-Neptune}-sized planets. In order
to aid in the physical interpretation of these radii, we compute model
radii for low-mass rocky planets with hydrogen-helium envelopes. We
provide model radii for planets 1-20 M <{SUB}>\&{oplus;</SUB}>, with envelope
fractions 0.01\%-20\%, levels of irradiation 0.1-1000 times Earth's, and
ages from 100 Myr to 10 Gyr. In addition we provide simple analytic fits
that summarize how radius depends on each of these parameters. Most
importantly, we show that at fixed {H/He} envelope fraction, radii show
little dependence on mass for planets with more than \~{}1\% of their mass
in their envelope. Consequently, planetary radius is to a first order a
proxy for planetary composition, i.e., {H/He} envelope fraction, for
Neptune- and {sub-Neptune}-sized planets. We recast the observed
mass-radius relationship as a mass-composition relationship and discuss
it in light of traditional core accretion theory. We discuss the
transition from rocky {super-Earths} to {sub-Neptune} planets with large

@article{Rappaport2013Roche,
    abstract = {The requirement that a planet must orbit outside of its Roche limit
gives a lower limit on the planet's mean density. The minimum density
depends almost entirely on the orbital period and is immune to
systematic errors in the stellar properties. We consider the
implications of this density constraint for the newly identified class
of small planets with periods shorter than half a day. When the planet's
radius is accurately known, this lower limit to the density can be used
to restrict the possible combinations of iron and rock within the
planet. Applied to {KOI} 1843.03, a 0.6 R <{SUB}>\&{oplus;</SUB}> planet with
the shortest known orbital period of 4.245 hr, the planet's mean density
must be \&gt;\~{} 7 g {cm<SUP}>-{3</SUP}>. By modeling the planetary
interior subject to this constraint, we find that the composition of the
planet must be mostly iron, with at most a modest fraction of silicates
(lsim 30\% by mass).},

@article{Jackson2009Observational,
    abstract = {The distribution of the orbits of close-in exoplanets shows evidence for
ongoing removal and destruction by tides. Tides raised on a planet's
host star cause the planet's orbit to decay, even after the orbital
eccentricity has dropped to zero. Comparison of the observed orbital
distribution and predictions of tidal theory shows good qualitative
agreement, suggesting tidal destruction of close-in exoplanets is
common. The process can explain the observed cutoff in small semimajor
axis values, the clustering of orbital periods near three days, and the
relative youth of transiting planets. Contrary to previous
considerations, a mechanism to stop the inward migration of close-in
planets at their current orbits is not necessarily required. Planets
nearing tidal destruction may be found with extremely small semimajor
axes, possibly already stripped of any gaseous envelope. The recently
discovered {CoroT}-7 b may be an example of such a planet and will
probably be destroyed by tides within the next few Gyrs. Also, where one
or more planets have already been accreted, a star may exhibit an
unusual composition and/or spin rate.},
